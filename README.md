Hi my name is Arthur.

# [Project 1: Regression](https://github.com/ArthurSarkissyan/Insurance-Charges-Prediction)
- There are a lot of factors that affect someone's health insurance costs.
- Here I tried to predict a person's insurance costs based on age, sex, bmi, amount of children, whether or not they smoke, and where they live.
- I tested linear regression (with lasso, ridge, and elastic net regularizations) as well as random forest regression.
