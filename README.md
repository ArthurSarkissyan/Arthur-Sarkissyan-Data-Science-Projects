Hi my name is Arthur.

# [Project 1: Regression](https://github.com/ArthurSarkissyan/Insurance-Charges-Prediction)
- There are a lot of factors that affect someone's health insurance costs.
- Here I tried to predict a person's insurance costs based on age, sex, bmi, amount of children, whether or not they smoke, and where they live.
- I tested linear regression (with lasso, ridge, and elastic net regularizations) as well as random forest regression. 

# [Project 2: Clustering](https://github.com/ArthurSarkissyan/Customer-Segmentation)
- With appropriate data, it is possible to split up customers into different clusters so that they can be selectively targeted by marketing campaigns.
- The goal of this project is to split the customers of a store into 8 to 10 different clusters to allow for selective targeting.
- The clustering techniques that were tested were KMeans clustering, agglomerative clustering, and DBSCAN.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality for facilitated visualization.
